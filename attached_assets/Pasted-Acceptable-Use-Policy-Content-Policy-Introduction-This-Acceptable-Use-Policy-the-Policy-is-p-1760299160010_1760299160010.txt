The Service will respond expeditiously to valid notices of alleged infringement under applicable law, including the EU legal framework and, where relevant, the U.S. DMCA.

A notice should include: identification of the copyrighted work; identification and location (URL) of the allegedly infringing material; the notifier’s name, postal address, telephone number, and email; a good‑faith statement that the use is not authorized; a statement made under penalty of perjury that the information is accurate and that the notifier is authorized to act; and an electronic or physical signature.

Send notices to: [contact email] or [web form URL].

A repeat‑infringer policy may result in account restrictions or termination where appropriate.

Where applicable, Users may submit a counter‑notice that meets legal requirements; disputed materials may remain disabled as required by law.

Enforcement measures
The Service may, at its discretion and where lawful:

Remove or disable access to offending content immediately.

Temporarily suspend or permanently terminate accounts.

Restrict features, throttle usage, or apply additional verification.

Indemnification
The User agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Service’s operators, maintainers, and contributors from claims, damages, liabilities, losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of the User’s violation of this Policy, User Content, misuse of the Service, or violation of third‑party rights.

Reporting
To report suspected violations, security issues, or illegal content, contact: [contact email] or [web form URL]. Include sufficient detail (links, timestamps, screenshots) to allow assessment and action.

Policy updates
This Policy may be amended or updated to reflect legal, regulatory, or operational requirements. Material changes will be communicated via the Service or by notice where required. Continued use after the effective date of changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Policy.

Relationship to other terms
This Policy supplements the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If there is a conflict, the Terms of Service control to the extent permitted by applicable law. Mandatory consumer and data‑protection rights under EU law remain unaffected.
