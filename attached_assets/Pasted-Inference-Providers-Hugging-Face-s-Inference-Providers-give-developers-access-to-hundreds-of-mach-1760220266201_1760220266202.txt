Authentication
You’ll need a Hugging Face token to authenticate your requests. Create one by visiting your token settings and generating a fine-grained token with Make calls to Inference Providers permissions.

For complete token management details, see our security tokens guide.

Quick Start - LLM
Let’s start with the most common use case: conversational AI using large language models. This section demonstrates how to perform chat completions using DeepSeek V3, showcasing the different ways you can integrate Inference Providers into your applications.

Whether you prefer our native clients, want OpenAI compatibility, or need direct HTTP access, we’ll show you how to get up and running with just a few lines of code.

Python
Here are three ways to integrate Inference Providers into your Python applications, from high-level convenience to low-level control:

For convenience, the huggingface_hub library provides an InferenceClient that automatically handles provider selection and request routing.

In your terminal, install the Hugging Face Hub Python client and log in:

Copied
pip install huggingface_hub
hf auth login # get a read token from hf.co/settings/tokens
You can now use the the client with a Python interpreter:

Copied
import os
from huggingface_hub import InferenceClient

client = InferenceClient()

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "How many 'G's in 'huggingface'?"
        }
    ],
)

print(completion.choices[0].message)
JavaScript
Integrate Inference Providers into your JavaScript applications with these flexible approaches:

Our JavaScript SDK provides a convenient interface with automatic provider selection and TypeScript support.

Install with NPM:

Copied
npm install @huggingface/inference
Then use the client with Javascript:

Copied
import { InferenceClient } from "@huggingface/inference";

const client = new InferenceClient(process.env.HF_TOKEN);

const chatCompletion = await client.chatCompletion({
  model: "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "How many 'G's in 'huggingface'?",
    },
  ],
});

console.log(chatCompletion.choices[0].message);
HTTP / cURL
For testing, debugging, or integrating with any HTTP client, here’s the raw REST API format. Our routing system automatically selects the most popular available provider for your chosen model. You can also select the provider of your choice by appending it to the model id (e.g. "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324:fireworks-ai").

Copied
curl https://router.huggingface.co/v1/chat/completions \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $HF_TOKEN" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{
        "messages": [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "How many G in huggingface?"
            }
        ],
        "model": "deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324",
        "stream": false
    }'
Quick Start - Text-to-Image Generation
Let’s explore how to generate images from text prompts using Inference Providers. We’ll use black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev, a state-of-the-art diffusion model that produces highly detailed, photorealistic images.

Python
Use the huggingface_hub library for the simplest image generation experience with automatic provider selection:

Copied
import os
from huggingface_hub import InferenceClient

client = InferenceClient(api_key=os.environ["HF_TOKEN"])

image = client.text_to_image(
    prompt="A serene lake surrounded by mountains at sunset, photorealistic style",
    model="black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev"
)

# Save the generated image
image.save("generated_image.png")
JavaScript
Use our JavaScript SDK for streamlined image generation with TypeScript support:

Copied
import { InferenceClient } from "@huggingface/inference";
import fs from "fs";

const client = new InferenceClient(process.env.HF_TOKEN);

const imageBlob = await client.textToImage({
  model: "black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev",
  inputs:
    "A serene lake surrounded by mountains at sunset, photorealistic style",
});

// Save the image
const buffer = Buffer.from(await imageBlob.arrayBuffer());
fs.writeFileSync("generated_image.png", buffer);
Provider Selection
The Inference Providers API acts as a unified proxy layer that sits between your application and multiple AI providers. Understanding how provider selection works is crucial for optimizing performance, cost, and reliability in your applications.

API as a Proxy Service
When using Inference Providers, your requests go through Hugging Face’s proxy infrastructure, which provides several key benefits:

Unified Authentication & Billing: Use a single Hugging Face token for all providers
Automatic Failover: When using automatic provider selection (provider="auto"), requests are automatically routed to alternative providers if the primary provider is flagged as unavailable by our validation system
Consistent Interface through client libraries: When using our client libraries, the same request format works across different providers
Because the API acts as a proxy, the exact HTTP request may vary between providers as each provider has their own API requirements and response formats. When using our official client libraries (JavaScript or Python), these provider-specific differences are handled automatically whether you use provider="auto" or specify a particular provider.

Client-Side Provider Selection (Inference Clients)
When using the Hugging Face inference clients (JavaScript or Python), you can explicitly specify a provider or let the system choose automatically. The client then formats the HTTP request to match the selected provider’s API requirements.

Copied
import { InferenceClient } from "@huggingface/inference";

const client = new InferenceClient(process.env.HF_TOKEN);

// Explicit provider selection
await client.chatCompletion({
  model: "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
  provider: "sambanova", // Specific provider
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello!" }],
});

// Automatic provider selection (default: "auto")
await client.chatCompletion({
  model: "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
  // Defaults to "auto" selection of the provider
  // provider="auto",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello!" }],
});
Provider Selection Policy:

provider: "auto" (default): Selects the first available provider for the model, sorted by your preference order in Inference Provider settings
provider: "specific-provider": Forces use of a specific provider (e.g., “together”, “replicate”, “fal-ai”, …)
Alternative: OpenAI-Compatible Chat Completions Endpoint (Chat Only)
If you prefer to work with familiar OpenAI APIs or want to migrate existing chat completion code with minimal changes, we offer a drop-in compatible endpoint that handles all provider selection automatically on the server side.

Note: This OpenAI-compatible endpoint is currently available for chat completion tasks only. For other tasks like text-to-image, embeddings, or speech processing, use the Hugging Face inference clients shown above.

Copied
import { OpenAI } from "openai";

const client = new OpenAI({
  baseURL: "https://router.huggingface.co/v1",
  apiKey: process.env.HF_TOKEN,
});

const completion = await client.chat.completions.create({
  model: "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello!" }],
});
This endpoint can also be requested through direct HTTP access, making it suitable for integration with various HTTP clients and applications that need to interact with the chat completion service directly.

Copied
curl https://router.huggingface.co/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HF_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Hello!"
      }
    ]
  }'
Key Features:

Server-Side Provider Selection: The server automatically chooses the best available provider
Model Listing: GET /v1/models returns available models across all providers
OpenAI SDK Compatibility: Works with existing OpenAI client libraries
Chat Tasks Only: Limited to conversational workloads
Choosing the Right Approach
Use Inference Clients when:

You need support for all task types (text-to-image, speech, embeddings, etc.)
You want explicit control over provider selection
You’re building applications that use multiple AI tasks
Use OpenAI-Compatible Endpoint when:

You’re only doing chat completions
You want to migrate existing OpenAI-based code with minimal changes
You prefer server-side provider management
Use Direct HTTP when:

You’re implementing custom request logic
You need fine-grained control over the request/response cycle
You’re working in environments without available client libraries
